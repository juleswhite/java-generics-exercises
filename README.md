# Overview

This programming exercise will help you practice Java Generics. 

Start by looking in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.generics.exercise1.DataContainer
class. You will need to complete the @ToDo instructions in this class and
get the DataContainerTest to compile and pass. 

When you are done, follow the instructions in DataContainer to uncomment
the statements in AttributedDataContainerTest and follow the instructions
at the end of DataContainer.

## Running the Tests

The tests for the assignment are contained in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live3.GeoHashDBTest
class. You can run this class as a JUnit test in your IDE or from the 
command line using "gradle test". Every time that you commit and push
to GitHub, GitHub Actions will compile and test your code. You can 
view the results on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
