/**
 * @ToDo
 *
 * The DataContainerTest does not compile because this class
 * isn't parameterizable with types that implement Attributed.
 *
 * Refactor the AttributedDataContainer class so that the "data"
 * can be parameterized with any type that implements the
 * Attributed interface.
 *
 * You should know what locations to update now, because you
 * completed exercise1.
 *
 * When you are done, the AttributedDataContainerTest should compile
 * and pass the test.
 *
 * After you have passed the AttributedDataContainerTest, uncomment
 * the lines in the MappingTest and
 * move on to the Mapping class.
